# 🛡️ Sietch Scanner (v1.0)

**Automated GitHub Security Auditing & Secret Detection Engine**

> *Stop vulnerabilities before they reach production.*

Sietch Scanner is a high-performance security auditing tool designed for DevSecOps teams and security researchers. Unlike basic regex scripts, Sietch uses a **hybrid traversal engine** that intelligently switches between API streaming and Git Tree snapshots to audit repositories of any size without exhausting API rate limits.

Detect hardcoded secrets, flag risky file signatures, and audit dependency chains—all in seconds.

## ⚡ Why Sietch?

Most scanners are either too slow (cloning the whole repo) or too shallow (missing files deep in the tree). Sietch Scanner solves this with a smarter approach:

* **🔍 Deep Packet Inspection:** Does not just look at filenames—it reads file content for high-risk patterns (AWS keys, private tokens).
* **🧠 Intelligent Traversal:** Automatically detects when a directory is too deep or complex and switches strategies to ensure 100% coverage.
* **⚡ Zero-Clone Scanning:** Audits directly via the GitHub API. No local storage required. No massive `git clone` delays.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

### 1. Adaptive Scanning Modes

* **📸 Snapshot Mode (Deep Audit):** Builds a complete in-memory map of the repository structure before scanning. Ideal for comprehensive compliance audits.
* **🚀 QuickScan Mode (Fast Audit):** Streams files immediately as they are discovered. Perfect for CI/CD pipelines needing instant feedback.

### 2. The "Hybrid" Engine

Sietch respects your API quota. It traverses standard directories normally, but upon hitting `MAX_DEPTH`, it instantly switches to a **Git Tree Snapshot**, retrieving thousands of nested files in a single API call.

### 3. Vulnerability Database

* **Secret Detection:** Pre-compiled regex patterns for AWS, Google Cloud, Slack, and generic private keys.
* **Supply Chain Security:** Parses `requirements.txt` to flag dependencies against a known vulnerability database (CVE-mapping ready).

## 🛠️ Quick Start

Get running in under 2 minutes.

**1. Clone & Enter**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SanjeevKrishna2470/Sietch_Scanner.git
cd Sietch_Scanner

```

**2. Arm the Scanner**

```bash
pip install PyGithub python-dotenv

```

**3. Authenticate**
Create a `.env` file to safely store your GitHub credentials (never hardcode them!).

```bash
# .env
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_personal_access_token_here

```

**4. Launch**

```bash
python main.py

```

## ⚙️ Surgical Configuration

Control the scanner's behavior with precision using JSON config files.

### `policy.json` (The Scope)

Define where the scanner should look—and where it shouldn't.

```json
{
  "ignore_dirs": [".git", "node_modules", "dist"],
  "max_depth": 5  // Automatically switches to Snapshot Strategy beyond this depth
}

```

### `signatures.json` (The Threat Intel)

Fully customizable rules engine. Add your own proprietary patterns or internal filenames.

* **`vulnerability_patterns`**: Regex for secrets.
* **`file_signatures`**: Dangerous filenames (`id_rsa`, `.pypirc`).
* **`dependency_files`**: Manifests to audit (`requirements.txt`, `package.json`).

## 📊 Actionable Reporting

Don't just get a pass/fail. Get a forensic report.
Sietch generates a `scan_results.json` artifact containing evidence for every finding:

```json
[
    {
        "rule_id": "aws_key",
        "risk": "CRITICAL",
        "file": "src/config/deploy.py",
        "evidence": "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
        "description": "Potential AWS Access Key ID detected",
        "timestamp": "2023-10-27T14:30:00"
    }
]

```

## 🗺️ Roadmap: The Path to v2.0

We are actively evolving Sietch Scanner from a powerful script into a CLI platform.

* ✅ **v1.0 (Current):** Core Logic, Hybrid Traversal, JSON Reporting.
* 🚧 **v1.5:** Multi-repo scanning & Organization-wide auditing.
* 🔜 **v2.0 (The CLI Update):** Full command-line interface (e.g., `sietch audit --org my-company --json`), removing the need for `main.py` entry.
* 🔜 **CI/CD Integration:** Native GitHub Action for PR blocking.
